# VIC---Vehicle-Inventory-Tracker
VIC is a Vehicle Inventory Tracker that allows a user to have a record of damaged vehicles.
This program is intended for sole company use, not for web services. Military, Mechanic Shop, ETC


Damaged Vehicles can be tracked when adding vehicle to the inventory tracker with a name and set ID. 
When a vehicle has been repaired, Scrapped, etc, the user can determine if the vehicle "case" has been RESOLVED. 
RESOLVED vehicles will still be in the vehicle tracker until the user has deemed it neccesary to delete the RESOLVED vehicle. 

I aim to improve functionality in the future by adding more options for the user to create a more organized list of the their vehicles. 
The format and GUI are basic and I aim to improve this in the future to create a standard modern look for the program. 

VIC is easily adaptable for different companies that are looking for an inventory system that is not for vehicles. 
The GUI is also has versatility to change depending on the branding needed when released.
